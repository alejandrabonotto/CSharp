## Overview
This repository contains lines of code that I've written during my C# studies.

## Running the Programs
To run the programs, follow these steps:

1. Open the project in your preferred C# development environment (Visual Studio, Visual Studio Code, etc.).
2. Compile and execute the main.cs file.
3. Follow any on-screen prompts or instructions.

# APPLICATIONS

## Basics Concepts

__*HR Application Folder*__
It is an HR application designed to perform the following tasks:

1. Main Menu: Users can select to add an employee, display employee information, or exit.
2. Add Employee Menu: Users can select the type of employee to add – commission employee, salaried employee, or hourly employee – or they can return to the Main Menu.
2.1. Commission Employee: Users provide the employee’s ID, name, total sales, and percentage of commission. The application then displays the total earnings.
2.2. Salaried Employee: Users provide the employee’s ID, name, and salary. There are three bonuses for this category. The application shows the total earnings according to the assigned bonus.
2.3. Hourly Employee: Users provide the employee’s ID, name, hourly rate, and total weekly hours worked. The application shows total earnings, considering any extra hours worked.
3. Display Employee Menu: Users can choose to display information for all employees, display information for a specific employee by ID, or return to the Main Menu.

This application demonstrates knowledge of basic concepts of C#, such as user inputs, if and else statements, switch statements, loops, break and return, arrays, and methods.

## Intermediate Concepts

__*Student Class 01**__
It is a simple code that shows the concept of a class and objects, properties and its getters and setters, and how to display the data implicitly and explicitly.

__*Student Class 02**__
It is a simple code that shows the concept of an abstract class and how to inherit from it. 
A class that is not able to be instantiated is called abstract. Rather, it acts as a basic class from which other classes might be derived. To provide a common set of attributes or behaviors that derived classes ought to possess, abstract classes are utilized. An abstract class cannot have objects created for it; instead, a derived class must be created from it. in order to use the derived class's object to access members of the abstract class.
